# SalesTaxes
This application serves as a prototype POS system for a store catalog.

In addition, this POS system allows users to add and remove products from a shopping catelog. Once a user adds their products to their
shopping cart, they can checkout their items and create a receipt which includes individual price items, calculated taxes, and overall
total cost of the cart.

There are a variety of items for sale at a store. When a customer purchases items, they receive a receipt. The receipt 
lists all of the items purchased, the sales price of each item (with taxes included), the total sales taxes for all items, 
and the total sales price. 

Basic sales tax applies to all items at a rate of 10% of the itemâ€™s list price, with the exception of books, food, and 
medical products, which are exempt from basic sales tax. An import duty (import tax) applies to all imported items at 
a rate of 5% of the shelf price, with no exceptions. 

This project was created using Microsoft's .Net Core and Facebook's React (w/ TypeScript).
